# Stopwatch-Application By Ankit Pandey
#Steps:

1. Initiate the process by crafting a central container that envelops all the essential elements.

2. Within this container, establish two nested divs: the first encapsulating time-related elements, including hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, while the second accommodates three buttons for commencing, pausing, resetting the stopwatch, and a "Record" button for capturing lap times.

3. Apply styling to ensure the div container is aesthetically centered, enhancing overall visual appeal.

4. Integrate a JavaScript file, where onclick functions are attributed to all four buttons. Additionally, create a dedicated function encompassing the logical code responsible for updating and displaying values for hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds. This function should also facilitate the recording of lap times when the "Record" button is activated during stopwatch operation.
